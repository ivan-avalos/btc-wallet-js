# Breakit.io – Codeando México challenge

This is the NodeJS version of the <a href="https://github.com/morfin/bitcoin_wallet_tutorial_with_py">bitcoin\_wallet\_tutorial\_with\_py</a> project, which shows how to generate a Bitcoin wallet, originally written in Python. I made this project for the Codeando México challenge from <a href="https://breakit.io">Breakit.io</a>.

## Rules

1. You must end up with two files: `main.js` and `utils.js`.
2. You must emulate every single Python line as much as possible.
3. You are allowed to find and use equivalent libraries for NodeJS, as the provided Python wallet script uses Python-exclusive libraries.
4. The script must not contain copy/pasted, plagiarized, colluded or unoriginal code. You are allowed to get inspiration from solutions.
